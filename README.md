1. Clone this repository
2. Run `sudo install.sh`
3. Open up new window to initiate `zsh` shell
4. Optional - run `gh auth login` to add git credentials

- Would like to improve the install script
- Handle installation on different OS (MacOS, Linux, WSL2)

### Future optimizations

- Improve install script by automating step 3 above, initializing the `zsh` environment
